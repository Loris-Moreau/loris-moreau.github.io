    <h3>Welcome, in this post I will talk about why & how I made some of the "workflow" I use.</h3>
    <h4><i>ps: workflow for me means a way of working or a sort of template.</i></h4>
    <h4>If you want to know the workflows go see the <a href="https://github.com/Loris-Moreau/Git-Workflow" target="_blank">Git repository</a> 
        where I go more in depth about these.</h4>
    
    <p style="padding: 2px"></p>
    
    <h3>I kept doing certain things over & over again <i>(e.g. Readme's)</i> & thought it would be nice to have some sort of template to use or a reference sheet for my work 
        instead of opening older repository to see how I did things, 
        so I made a <a href="https://github.com/Loris-Moreau/Git-Workflow" target="_blank">Git repository</a> that I would use strictly for that purpose.</h3>
    <h3>Whenever I tried something new I check to see : </h3>
    <h3>- The best practices <i>(how to declare stuff, naming conventions, etc...)</i>, </h3>
    <h3>- How to efficiently do this process, </h3>
    <h3>- And some nice to have <i>(shortcuts, references, etc...)</i> </h3>
    <h4> <i>Most of these were made for projects to help the teams understand the processes & not break everything.</i> </h4>
    
    <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
    
    <h3>The first one I made was a <a href="https://github.com/Loris-Moreau/Git-Workflow" target="_blank">GitHub Workflow</a> for a project to make sure that those that didn't know how to use Git could have a cheatsheet to make sure they didn't break anything <i>(spoilers: they still did)</i></h3>
    <h3>Then since we were working on unreal I looked into 
        <a href="https://github.com/Loris-Moreau/Git-Workflow/tree/main/Workflows/Unreal%20Engine/RevisionControl.md" target="_blank">revision control</a>, 
        <a href="https://github.com/Loris-Moreau/Git-Workflow/tree/main/Workflows/Unreal%20Engine/Level%20Streaming.md" target="_blank"> Level Streaming</a>, 
        <a href="https://github.com/Loris-Moreau/Git-Workflow/tree/main/Workflows/Unreal%20Engine/World%20Partition.md" target="_blank"> World Partition</a> & 
        <a href="https://github.com/Loris-Moreau/Git-Workflow/tree/main/Workflows/Unreal%20Engine/PCG.md" target="_blank"> PCG</a></h3>
    
    <h3>Then I got interested in <a href="https://github.com/Loris-Moreau/Git-Workflow/tree/main/Workflows/Environement" target="_blank">environments</a> <i>(Containers, YALM, etc...)</i></h3>
    
    <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
    
    <h3>And more will be added as I learn more & more.</h3>
    
    <h3>Feel free to use these to help yourself, and if they aren't to your taste then that's fine maybe modify them a little or even better make your own workflows !</h3>
    
    
    <!-- The End -->
    <p style="padding: 15px"></p>
    <h3>Until we meet again, hehehe</h3>
